Task 03: Decision Tree Classification
Internship Task Overview

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The objective of Task 03 is to build and evaluate a Decision Tree classification model using the Bank Marketing dataset.

Objective

Understand the structure of the bank marketing dataset.

Perform data preprocessing and encoding.

Analyze important features influencing predictions.

Train a Decision Tree classification model.

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

Visualize the trained decision tree.

Dataset Description

The dataset used in this task is stored in bank.csv.

It contains demographic, social, and campaign-related features of bank clients, which are used to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (y).

Tasks Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset.

Checked and handled categorical data.

Encoded categorical features using label encoding.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained a Decision Tree classifier using entropy criterion.

Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualized the decision tree for better interpretability.

Tools and Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights

The dataset was successfully preprocessed and encoded.

Decision Tree provided interpretable results.

Important features influencing client subscription were identified.

The trained model achieved reasonable prediction accuracy.

Visualization helped in understanding the decision-making process of the model.

Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience in implementing a classification model using a Decision Tree algorithm.

It enhanced my understanding of:

Data preprocessing and encoding

Classification algorithms

Model evaluation techniques

Decision tree visualization and interpretation
