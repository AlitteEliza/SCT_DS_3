# Task 03: Decision Tree Classification

## Internship Task Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.  
The objective of Task 03 is to implement a Decision Tree classification model using the Bank Marketing dataset.

## Objective
- Understand the structure of the dataset.
- Perform data preprocessing and encoding.
- Analyze important features in the data.
- Train a Decision Tree classification model.
- Evaluate model performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this task contains marketing data stored in `bank.csv`.

It includes multiple client-related features used for analysis and prediction.

## Tasks Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset.
- Checked for missing values.
- Performed data preprocessing and label encoding.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained a Decision Tree classification model.
- Evaluated the model using performance metrics.
- Visualized the decision tree.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Insights
- The dataset was successfully cleaned and prepared.
- Important features influencing predictions were identified.
- The Decision Tree model achieved reasonable accuracy.
- Model visualization improved interpretability.

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding the complete workflow of a classification-based machine learning project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

It improved my knowledge of:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Classification algorithms
- Decision Tree models
